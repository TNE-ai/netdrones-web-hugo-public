A difficult question, but a responsible owner will ask, what do you need and why do you need it. Then ask if they have the capability and are they currently proficient.

> Just buying a gun is not responsible ownership. Responsible means having a safe place to store it, the training to use and the currency and practice to operate it when needed.
