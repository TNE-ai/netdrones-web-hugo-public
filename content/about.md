### Hello, We are **Responsible.org**

Responsible.org&trade; is a non-profit dedicated to the idea that we don't have
to trade off security and safety. As gun owners, we support the 2nd Amendment
but also know that with great power comes great responsibility. Without
adequate needs analysis, proper purchase, adequate initial training, and
consistent re-qualification, having a weapon can needlessly endanger everyone.

We are always looking for new members, so feel to send us a note and join us.
