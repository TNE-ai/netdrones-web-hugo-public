Responsible.org is a non-profit dedicated to the idea that we don't have to trade off security and safety. As gun owners, we support the 2nd Amendment but also know that with great power comes great responsibility. Without adequate needs analysis, proper purchase, adequate initial training, and consistent re-qualification, having a weapon can needlessly endanger everyone.
