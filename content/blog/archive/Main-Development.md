At NetDrones&trade;, we work on the tools that make it easier for drone
operators to plan, practice and process the data from their flights.

We work on a variety of advanced technologies that enable the next generation
of productivity for individual drone pilots and operators of large drone fleets
to:

- Plan their missions. Not for just a single drone but for flight that include
    dozens and soon hundreds of drones working together.
- Practice the maneuvers. So it not on the job training, but realistic
    simulation of what they will encounter.
- Process. Ensure the right data is being collected while on site so you never
    have to go back and redo the work.
