NetDrones&trade; provides organizations with the hardware they need to be
successful with reference designs.

- Sensor Add-ons. You do not need new hardware to realize your dreams. Our
    add-on sensor packs make even ordinary cars, trucks and e-bikes tools for
    collecting data in the world. They can also be added on to the drones
    you've already purchased so you extend the life of expensive hardware and
    training.
- Lightweight Drones. Our experts are building a series of reference designs
    that are ultra-lightweight and ultra-low power, dramatically extending the
    range of applications for you.
- Designs that scale. Our world-class hardware engineering have developed
    add-on sensors, mobility packages and other components that are ready to
    be built at scale.
