NetDrones&trade; has extensive experience in building high-scale cloud compute
that process the massive datasets that sensors in motion are generating. It
doesn't matter if it is mounted on a car, bicycle, robot or flying drone, we
can handle:

- High speed upload. Our technology allows high performance and high-scale
    uploads of information. We focus on both high efficiency and other
    compression techniques to bring the data to you quickly.
- High scale storage. Our systems allow petabyte storage and high speed
    analysis of 3-D data with full roll back backward and forward in time.
- High scale data analysis and machine learning. We use this with advanced data
    analysis as well as in-cloud machine learning and automated model
    distribution back to the edge.
