Responsible.org&trade;'s latest foray into promotion of the responsible gun
ownership possession and use is to move beyond the written world. We know that
it's much easier to understand things when we provide:

- Podcasts. We are about to launch a series of podcasts and a service that
    summarizes useful audio content for you. So stay tuned, we will be
    appearing on Apple, Spotify and other podcast sites soon.
- Vlogs. We have all done it; looked at YouTube as the source for responsible gun
    ownership and use. Our first effort will be to curate the information that
    is already online so that you get the most accurate information that you
    need.
- Social Media. This is a lot of work, but we are just starting work on social
    media feeds including the usual suspects like Facebook and Twitter.

This is a new direction for us, so we welcome your feedback on how to have an
impact on your lives and the people you know. Send us a note and let us note
how you think we should proceed.
