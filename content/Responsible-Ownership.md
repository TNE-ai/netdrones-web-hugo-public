The decision to buy a firearm is a big one. Understanding why you need one is
key. Owning a weapon is a means to an end, so understanding the end is
important, some of the common reasons are:

- Home Defense. You are worried about your family at home and want to make sure
    they are safe.
- Personal Defense. You are worried about those times outside of the house and
    want to make sure you are safe.
- Hunting. You want to take provide for your family and be closer to the
    process of providing for them.
- Competition. You want to build your skills in the difficult area of
    marksmanship.
- Recreation. Let's face it, it's just plain fun (as long as its safe) to get
    out with the boys and plink some targets.

These are all great reasons to own a weapon, but in each case, particularly for
defense, you have to ask if:

- You have assessed the risks appropriately and ensured your security with
    other more inexpensive yet very effective means.
- You are thinking about the right tool for the job and that you have the time
    and ability to employ the weapon.
