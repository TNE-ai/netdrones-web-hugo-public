you to keep you up to date on the latest trends in firearms policy, research
and news. These include:

- News briefs. Sign up now for the late breaking events in the world of
    responsible gun ownership.
- Fact Sheets. There are so many sources that don't give you the complete view
    on what is happening really with gun ownership possession and use as well
    as public policy, user research and political issues. Use Fact Sheet is a
    great resource to cut through all the noise.
- Reports. We are a great resource for finding large scale demographic studies,
    academic research and laboratories studies that give you great insight into
    the problem.
